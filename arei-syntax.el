(defconst arei-syntax--module-re
  "^[[:blank:]]*([[:blank:]\n]*define-module[[:blank:]\n]+\\(([^)]+)\\)"
  "Regular expression matching a top-level definition of the module.")

(defconst arei-syntax--library-re
  "^[[:blank:]]*([[:blank:]\n]*\\(?:define-\\)?library[[:blank:]\n]+\\(([^)]+)\\)"
  "Regular expression matching a top-level definition of the library.")

(defun arei-current-module ()
  "Find current buffer's module.  It goes backwards and looking for
`arei--module-re' or `arei--library-re' to match, after that it
goes the opposite direction.  This logic is not perfect, but
works good enough for this amount of code.  Also, it's similar
to geiser and cider approaches.  In the future it would be better
to extract this information from tree-sitter or some other more
preciese way."
